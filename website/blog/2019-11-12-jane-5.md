Jane is a set of libraries to generate models & API clients based on OpenApi specs. It will generate everything you need to use your API such as endpoints and related exceptions if needed.

<!--truncate-->

As a reminder, OpenApi Specification is an API description format or API definition language. Basically, an OpenApi Specification allows you to describe an API including (among other things):
- General information about the API
- Available paths (`/resources`)
- Available operations on each path (`get /resources`)
- Input/Output for each operation

The previous version of JanePHP was released in February 2018 and used [OpenApi 2 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md), async support and our first documentation.

Since that release, [Jane’s OpenApi library](https://github.com/janephp/open-api) has been installed more than 40,000 times 🎉.

At JoliCode, we are using Jane in a lot of different projects, to make API communication simpler and to build full API clients, such as: [Slack](https://github.com/jolicode/slack-php-api), [Docker](https://github.com/docker-php/docker-php-api), [Harvest](https://github.com/jolicode/harvest-php-api) or [Forecast](https://github.com/jolicode/forecast-php-api).

## Why is Jane 5 cooler than 4? 😎

A year after the previous version, we chose to release Jane 5.0 with two major features:

### OpenApi 3.0.2 support 📝

Since Swagger 2.0 (OpenApi is the new name of Swagger), a lot of changes has been made:
- `definitions` becomes `components/schemas`;
- Inside endpoint parameters, model definition is now indexed by a `schema` key;
- Again in endpoint parameters, `in: body` objects have a new separated field called `requestBody`;
- Better support for content-type negotiation.

Many other features can be found on [OpenApi 3.0 release blog post](https://swagger.io/blog/news/announcing-openapi-3-0/) or [the very detailed ReadMe blog post](https://blog.readme.io/an-example-filled-guide-to-swagger-3-2/).

### PSR-18 Client generation 🛠

[PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) is a standard made by [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/) to harmonize HTTP Clients among PHP.

This allows us to use any PSR-18 compatible client (including Symfony's [HttpClient](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_client.html#psr-18) component). With this release it's preferable to use a PSR-18 Client than [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/).

## A quick example 🔎

First, you'll need to require jane-php packages:
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer require --dev jane-php/open-api "^5.0"
composer require jane-php/open-api-runtime "^5.0"</code></pre>

OpenApi package is only needed to generate classes. OpenApiRuntime is needed to use theses classes.

Now, we need to configure Jane before generation. We create a `.jane-openapi` file:
<pre><code class="language-php">return [
    'openapi-file' => __DIR__ . '/schema.yaml',
    'namespace' => 'CatFacts\Api',
    'directory' => __DIR__ . '/generated/',
];
</code></pre>

It will contain a reference to your main schema file, the PHP namespace you want for generated classes and the directory you want to use. Other configuration can be made in that file, [read more in the documentation about it](https://jane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenAPI/generate.html#configuration-file). Also, the schema used here can be found [in the documentation with more details](https://jane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenAPI/example.html#openapi-schema).

After that, one line will generate classes based on your schema:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ vendor/bin/jane-openapi generate</code></pre>

Then you can use them to communicate with your API 🎉
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ tree generated/
generated/
├── Client.php
├── Endpoint
│   └── RandomFact.php
├── Model
│   └── Fact.php
└── Normalizer
    ├── FactNormalizer.php
    └── NormalizerFactory.php

3 directories, 5 files</code></pre>
