Two months after v5.2 and four months after [v5.0](https://jolicode.com/blog/jane-5-0-has-been-released), we are releasing v5.3 with focus on three things:
- Performance
- Authentication
- OpenAPI 2

<!--truncate-->


## Performance

Before, generating a really big OpenAPI schema was very long. We even had issues where the generation took [more than 40 minutes](https://github.com/janephp/janephp/issues/180)! Thanks to [@lyrixx](https://twitter.com/lyrixx) & [@bastnic](https://twitter.com/bastnic) who took time to dig into Janeâ€™s generation process and turned those 40 minutes into just 20 seconds!

We also deprecated the `NormalizerFactory` replaced by `JaneObjectNormalizer` which will load needed Normalizers only when needed. This change can have a really huge impact on schemas with a lot of models (In the related PR, with 509 Normalizers we go from 57ms to 3.5ms during class autoload).

You can see more details into the related PR:
- [GH#197](https://github.com/janephp/janephp/pull/197) Local cache for Reference contents;
- [GH#210](https://github.com/janephp/janephp/pull/210) Added JaneObjectNormalizer to lazy-load Normalizer when needed;
- [GH#227](https://github.com/janephp/janephp/pull/227) Fixing JSON Pointer being created too much time.

## Authentication support

OpenAPI has a `securitySchemes` field to describe authentication and authorization schemes. With v5.3 we introduced support for authentication types `http` & `apiKey` (`oauth2` is a bit harder to implement, but we're open to contribution if you want to give it a try!).

In your schema, you'll have the following description:

```yaml
securityDefinitions:
  Bearer:
    type: http
    scheme: Bearer
  ApiKey:
    type: apiKey
    in: query
    name: api_key
```

Jane will now generate:
- `BearerAuthentication` for `Bearer` scheme which will inject a given token in an HTTP Header (see: [related example](https://github.com/janephp/janephp/blob/master/src/OpenApi/Tests/fixtures/authentication-http-bearer/expected/Authentication/BearerAuthentication.php));
- `ApiKeyAuthentication` for `ApiKey` scheme which will inject a `api_key` query parameter with your token to all requests (see: [related example](https://github.com/janephp/janephp/blob/master/src/OpenApi/Tests/fixtures/authentication-apiKey-query/expected/Authentication/ApiKeyAuthentication.php)).

And to use them, you have to do the following:

```php
$httpClient = new Psr18Client();
// setup your HttpClient ...

$client = Client::create($httpClient, new BearerAuthentication('token')); // with Bearer auth
$client = Client::create($httpClient, new ApiKeyAuthentication('apiKey')); // with ApiKey auth
```

And after that, all your requests will be authenticated! ðŸ”“ðŸŽ‰

Next step is to support authentication scopes on Jane generated endpoints to allow you to have multiple security schemes and Jane choose the right one to use!

## OpenAPI 2 backport

Before v5.3, **OpenAPI 2** was only supported on the v4.x branch and it was such a pain to maintain. To make it easier to maintain and to use, we moved the component to the `master` branch as `open-api-2` component! We even splitted all features that are in common with OpenAPI 3 to allow OpenAPI 2 to take advantage of OpenAPI 3 enhancements at no cost (including performance & [Authentication support](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) ðŸ˜‰).

Here is a diff to show the related changes you have to do in your `composer.json`:

```diff
    "require": {
-        "jane-php/open-api-runtime": "^4",
+        "jane-php/open-api-runtime": "^5",
    },
    "require-dev": {
-        "jane-php/open-api": "^4",
+        "jane-php/open-api-2": "^5",
    },
```

As a result of this change, `jane-php/open-api` component is now deprecated and should be replaced by `jane-php/open-api-3`, on our next major version (`v6`) it will be removed. And the v4.x and all related tags are also deprecated and should be replaced by `jane-php/open-api-2` component.

Here is a diff to show the related changes you have to do in your `composer.json`:

```diff
    "require-dev": {
-        "jane-php/open-api": "^5",
+        "jane-php/open-api-3": "^5",
    },
```
